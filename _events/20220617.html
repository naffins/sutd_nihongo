<p>Today we learn about Kirigami a bit by making a beautiful and cute bow! We transformed a boring piece of A4 paper into a masterpiece by following the steps here: https://www.gathered.how/papercraft/origami/kirigami/, such beautiful bows in the end~</p>
<p>Kirigami builds upon origami since it also includeds paper folding, however the use of scissors to make cuts is the unique aspect of it. Aside from making the bow, we also tried to make a Kirigami Pop-Up card by tracing a pattern from YouTube, cutting it, and folding it to make an awesome 3D staircase effect!</p>
<p>At the end of the session, everyone brought home a souvenir: their self-made Kirigami bow and art piece.</p>
