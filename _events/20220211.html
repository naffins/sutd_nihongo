<p>February is the month for romance and all things lovey dovey. To commemorate this special month and Valentine's Day, SUTD NiHonGo! decided to set up a booth made for couples to increase their "doki doki power" by participating in attractions.</p>

<p>Invite your special someone to play cooperative Taiko no Tatsujin with electronic drums modeled after traditional Taiko drums! Play casually for fun while singing to your favorite Anime, Vocaloid, or J-pop tunes, alternatively flex your rhythm game skills while bonding with your best friend.</p>

<p>We have also set up a special Photo Booth where couples have the opportunity to wear authentic Japanese kimonos, use emoji and love message as props, and bring home a picture of themselves complete with beautiful sakura blossoms and a traditional Japanese wooden frame as the backdrop.</p>
