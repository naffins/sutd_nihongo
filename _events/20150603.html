<p>On the 3rd of June and 17th of June this year, our club and Waseda Shibuya Senior High School in Singapore came together on a mission to manufacture kind apparels for the school’s 25th School Festival (Seiransai/星蘭祭). Though the initial meeting was a little tense, both parties warmed up to each other fast, and in no time, everyone had their focus on the goal - to print those beautiful designs via silk-screen printing onto the tote bags and fans, together. </p>

<p>Thank you all for contributing to the success of yet another Nihongo!’s club exchanges. We wish Waseda Shibuya Senior High School a successful and exciting Seiransai!</p>
