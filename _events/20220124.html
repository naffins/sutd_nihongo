<p>To start off the year of 2022, SUTD NiHonGo! invites members old and new to engage in an Omamori Crafting session on 24th of January 2022.</p>

<p>Unlike previous Omamori making workshops or sessions which uses paper as the Omamori base, the material we use here are fabric and some needles for sewing to indulge members in a more authentic and traditional Omamori making experience. Aside from learning and crafting this session was also a great opportunity for members to know each other better and mingle together as we struggle to perform the elegant but complex Omamori ending knot.<p>

<p>In the end, everyone managed to create their very own unique Omamori, hope this will help to provide success and happiness for 2022 ^-^</p>
