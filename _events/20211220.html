<p>On the 27th of October 2021, our club hosted a Culture Session focusing on prominent board games in Japanese culture. </p>

<p>We are split into small groups where each one corresponds to a particular board game, among the games we played includes Go, Shogi, and Hanafuda. </p>

<p>These fun and unique games allows us to strategize moves in our mind and compete in a friendly manner to come out victorious and earn bragging rights! </p>
