description: "Join us on our workshop where we'll introduce the omamori, also known as Japanese lucky charm, and teach you how to make your very own omamori using readily-available materials! No art or crafting experience is needed, though having some would help in bringing your designs to life."

<p>In the month of December, SUTD NiHonGo! participated in an Inter-Uni Winter Festival which involves a plethora of Japanese Culture / Anime Clubs all over Singapore to create the perfect holiday for avid Japanese enthusiasts~ </p>

<p>One of the highlights of the Winter Festival is the Omamori making workshop conducted on the 21st of December 2021. We got to make friends with students from NUS and SIM during the workshop, united by our love for all things Japanese. The event starts with learning what an Omamori is and the etiquettes we should always follow, Remember not to open your Omamori as the luck will escape! We then proceeded to play Gartic Phone as an icebreaker and laughed a lot since some of the drawings are really silly and people have very creative ideas~ </p>

<p>Everyone presented their very own special Omamori and we took a group photo together at the end of the session.</p>
