<p>In this Calligraphy based session SUTD NihonGo! invites a special guest from the SUTD community itself: Daniel Low, a master of the pen and ink with an enthusiasm for all things Calligraphy, where he will share his knowledge and guide our members in their journey towards Japanese language mastery.</p>

<p>At first, writing the Hiragana may seem deceptively simple and easy as they mostly consist of a few strokes however it turned out to be much harder and trickier since handling the Brushpen itself is also an art of its own. One major challenge was obtaining a different level of thickness in one part of the stroke to another and creating a sharp crisp at the ends of the character, beginners are prone to extremely thick strokes due to improper brush handling but we did not give up and keep up trying. In the session, Guru Daniel explained the origin of each Kana and happily guided each and every member patiently to ensure everyone gets some feedback to improve their writing.<p>

<p>We are able to complete and learn the entire Japanese Hiragana in the end and proud to bring back home our very own Calligraphy paper marked with all of the Kana as a reminder of our long but fruitful journey.</p>
