<p>Last weekend, a few of us met up to catch the movie Kaze Tachinu together. This film is celebrated animation master Hayao Miyazaki's final film and is based of the life story of renowned Japanese aircraft engineer, Jiro Horikoshi. </p>

<p>We then headed to Ippudo x TAO (@ UE Square) for a scrumptious ramen dinner! </p>

<p>Here's to many many more outings to come! We look forward to more of you joining us in our next outing! The more, the merrier!</p>
