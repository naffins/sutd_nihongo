<p>Shogi is quite similar to Western Chess with the main objective of capturing the opponent's King. The board is packed with unique pieces such as the Lance which can only move forward and the Golden and Silver generals which moves like the King albeit weaker. In its evolution, Shogi developed a unique mechanic of Dropping which allows captured pieces to get back into action and this leads to interesting strategies.</p>
<p>We also take a look at some of the bizarre Shogi variants such as the Dōbutsu shōgi which has cute animal tiles, made for children, and the Taikyoku shōgi which is the largest known Shogi to ever exist with 36 x 36 tiles and 207 type of pieces.</p>
<p>We solved some Shogi puzzles together as a team and proceeded to the second game, Koi-Koi which is played with Hanafuda playing cards. In this game there are 12 seasons which coincides with the 12 months in a year, and the objective is to collect cards and create special combinations known as Yaku.</p>
<p>The cards are decorative with different kinds of objects, such as animals, poetry slips, and there are bright cards can score extremely high. We engaged in 1 v 1 games, believing in the heart of the cards to score amazing combos. In the end, everyone tried a piece of Shogi and Hanafuda and expanded their knowledge of Japan.</p>
