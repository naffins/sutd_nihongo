<p>On the 27th of October 2021, our club hosted a Culture Session focusing on prominent board games in Japanese culture. The session aims to provide information about traditional Japanese games and as well as a hands-on activity of playing the games. </p>

<p>We are split into small groups where each one corresponds to a particular board game, among the games we played includes Go, Shogi, and Hanafuda. Go is a deceptively simple strategy game where the objective is to turn more game pieces into your color by flipping them, a versus between White and Black for ultimate domination! Shogi is similar in some ways to classic Chess with military ranks and an extra layer of promotion system as part of gameplay. Hanafuda is a seasonal card game with colorful plants, animals, and scenery where players try to gain points by forming card combos and hands to become the ultimate art aficionado.</p>

<p>These fun and unique games allows us to strategize moves in our mind and compete in a friendly manner to come out victorious and earn bragging rights! </p>
