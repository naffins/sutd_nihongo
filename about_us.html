		SUTD NihonGo aims to promote interest in and knowledge of Japanese culture among our fellow SUTDents.
		To that end, our club regularly holds weekly cultural sessions, where our members take turns to present parts of Japanese culture that they are passionate and have much to share about.
		We also hold occassional internal activities such as eat-togethers, and usually prior to every June/December, group study for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT).
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides internal events, we also organise events every year for fellow SUTDents not necessarily within our club. Besides being meant 
		to spread awareness of Japanese culture, we often design them so that they serve as opportunities for our friends to relax and have fun after a hard day of studying. 
		Some of the events we have held in the past include a Cultural Games Night (in collaboration with other SUTD cultural clubs) and an omamori-making workshop (in collaboration with SUTD MVMC).
	</p>
	<p>
		Moreover, our members also help to maintain links between SUTD and Japanese colleges and universities, by hosting activities such as exchanges. 
		One example is with Tokyo Institute of Technology, where we annually host students visiting from said university each year and set up traditional local games and activities for them to enjoy.
