            <h2>About SUTD NihonGo!</h2>
        </header>
        <p>SUTD NihonGo is SUTD's Japanese cultural club. Our regular club activities are mainly weekly cultural sessions where our members share about various aspects of Japan culture.
            Every year, we also conduct activities aimed at fellow SUTDents such as workshops and our annual exhibition at SUTD's Campus Centre. Besides these, we also maintain relations between SUTD and other Japanese colleges and schools through activities such as exchanges and tours.
